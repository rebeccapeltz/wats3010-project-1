## HTML  
1. Create files: index.html and css/style.css.  Use VS code to generate default html in the index.html file (hint: use !<tab> in VS Code.).  Link CSS file into the html.  Add a meta tag to specify you as the author `<meta name="author" content="<your name">`

2. You can find all content in the files located in the content directory.  

3. Code the semantic html to provide document structure:  
  header        **Home**  
  nav  
  figure  
  main  
  ---- section  **Recent Blogs**  
  ---- section  **About**  
  footer  

4. Add head tags to the `header` element and supply the title and subtitle using content from the **titles-captions.txt** files.
5. Add 2 div tags within the `nav` element. Add an unordered list tag (`ul`) inside each of the div elements. The list on the left should contain list items (`li`) with content and links (`a`) to **Home**, **Recent Blogs**, and **About**.  These will be linked to internal links. The list items on the right should contain links to "Twitter", "Facebook" and "Github" and will be external links.
6. The figure element should contain an image (`img`) and a caption (`figcaption`).  The image source is "images/backlit-clouds-dark-831x200.jpg" and the caption is in the titles-captions.txt file.  
7. The **Recent Blogs** section will use a CSS Table layout using 1 row and 3 columns. 
  - First add a head tag with the word "Recent Blogs" to describe the section. 
  - Add a div tag for the row and 3 child divs within the row to represent the 3 columns. 
  - Within each column add an image (`img`) and a paragraph (`p`).  The images can be found in the images directory and the content for paragraphs in the recent-blogs.txt file.  The order of the images is : **hudson-river..**, **fort-point...**, **prince-william...**.
8. The **About** section will use a CSS Table layout using 1 row and 2 columns.
  - First add the a head tag with the word "About" to describe the section.
  - Add a div tag for the row and and 2 child divs within the row to represent the 2 columns.  
  - Within each column add a head tag with a paragraph.  The head tags should contain the words "News" and "About".  The content for the news and about paragraphs are in the correpsonding content directory files. There are 2 paragraphs in the News Section.
9. Within the div tag representing the column for "About" place a `div` tag that will by styled to be a call to action (CTA) area with a child `button` element and make it's content "Click to find out more".
10. In the footer section add 2 div tags to represent the left and right contents of the footer. The contents of the left should contain the copyright information `Copyright &copy; 2019-20` and the contents on the right should contain your name.
11. Internal Page Links: In order to support internal navigation add id attributes to head tag for the **Recent Blogs** section and the head tag for the **About** section.  Then use these id's in the page links section of the nav element by assigning the `#<id>` to the `href`.  You can set the home link `href` to `#` string to cause the page to go to the start of the document. Test this out by clicking on these links.
12. Add a favicon using the `t.png` file in images directory. 
```
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="images/t.png">
```
13. Add the main title from title-captions.txt to the title tag in the head section.
## CSS
1. Normalize the styles (overrided default browser styles)
  - set body height to 100%
  - use the `*` selector and set box sizing to border box
  - set margin and padding to 0, line-height to 1.2 rem and text transform to uppercase on all `head` tags
  - set `ul` margin and padding to 0
  - set `main` margin top and bottom to 0 and left and right to 20px
  - set `p` padding top and bottom to 0 and left and right to 5px
2. Typography
  - set `h1` and `h2` font family to `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`
  - set `h1` and `h2` margin to 0
  - set `h1` font size to 3rem
  - set `h2` font size to 1rem 
  - set `h2` letter spacing to .2rem
  - set `h2` padding top to 0, right to 10px, bottom to 15px, and right to 10px
  - set `nav`, `div`, `a`, `figcaption` and `span` tages to font family `'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif`
3. Page Links
  - create a class called `page-links` and assign it to the `ul` that contains the navigation internal links. The `ul` overflow should be set to hidden to release the float after the element. Following the pattern established in ** Skills 1-4 Layout Horizonal ** assignment, float the list items to the left, remove bullet points and give them a background color of `#333`. Make the `a` tags block and the text white. Align the text to the center, remove the underline from the links (`text-decoration:none`) and add top and side padding.  On hover of the link set the background color to gray and the text color to white. When the link is `active` set the background color to black and the text color to white.
4. Social links
  - create a class called `social-links` and assign it to the `ul` that contains the social linnks.  Use `display:inline-block` on the list items `li` to cause them to layout horizontally following the pattern in the **Skills 1-4 Layout Horizonal** assignment.  Set list style type to none to remove bullet points and then set height and line-height in the `ul` to 48px, so that the text will center vertically.  The list items should all be equal in width (`5rem`) with a background color of `#ffbf00` and centered text alignment.  The social links `a` tags should have black text and remove the default underline with `text-decoration: none`.  On hovering the `a`'s the text should be white and hovering the `li`'s the text should be gray.
5. Positioning the Page Links and Social links to appear on the same line in the nav
  - use `position:relative` on the `nav` in order to apply absolute positioning on the children (page links and social links) See the **Skills 1-4 Layout Horizontal** assignment where the footer used absolute positioning to move contents to left and right for example
  - the nav should be 48px with a black background
  - assign the `div` that contains the page links a class of `nav-left` and the `div` that contains the social links should be given a class of `nav-right`
  - apply `position: absolute` to both `nav-left` and `nav-right`
  - `nav-left` will be positioned at `right:0, top:0` and `nav-right` will be positioned at `left:0, top:0`
6. Big Image Figure: set the margin to 0 on the figure and set the width to 100% and height to auto. This ensures that the image covers the full width of the page no matter how big the window is.
7. Table layouts are used for both the Recent Blogs and About sections.  The table layout will be controlled by the number of rows and columns as well as the amount of content.
  - create a class named `table` and assign it to sections containing **Recent Blogs** and **About**.  Create a table class selector in the style sheet and give it the following properties and values:

  ```
  {
    display: table;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    table-layout: fixed;
    border-collapse: separate;
    border-spacing: 10px;
  }
  ```

- create a row class and assign it to the divs that are direct children of the section elements and give them the rows the following style  

```
.row {
    display: table-row;
 }
```

- create a `col` class and add the `col` class to any `div`'s that are children of the `row` class and then style the cols and `p` children with the following
 
 ```
.col {
        display: table-cell;
        border: 1px solid lightgray;
        border-radius: 10px;
    }

    .col p {
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
 ```
8. Float the text in the **Recent Blogs** section around the images by adding a `wrapped` class to the images and set them to `display:block` and `float:left`.  Add 5px padding. See the **Skills 1-6 images-float-text** for reference.
  
9. Call to action button styling 
  - assign a `cta` class to the div around the button and give it a width of `11rem`, `margin:auto` and center align the text
  - assign a `cta-button` class to the button and make it a block element with a heigth of `40px`, a line height of `40px`, a red backgound, white text and `border-radius` of `30px`
10. Footer
  - provide a background color of '#333', height of '4rem' and text color white
  - give it a padding of 20 and **position relative** with a width of 100%
  - create a `footer-left` and `footer-right` class and assign them to the 2 `div`'s nested in the `footer`
  - set absolute position for both `footer-right` and `footer-left`
  - set a property of `left: 0.50%` on `footer-left`
  - set a property of `right: 0.50%` on `footer-right`
